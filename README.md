# Learning React Record App

A simple and easy to improve architecture for building production ready React application.

## Introduction

React has a rich library and sophisticated official documentation and tutorials, which makes it easy to create frontend applications.
However, while it is easy to create complex functions, there is a danger of writing threadbare code.
Therefore, I created this application to be able to write simple and refinable code.
I write my code with the intention of creating a loosely coupled system with condensed functionality.
I am a new engineer, so if you have any suggestions for improvement, please comment.  

The directory structure and functional assignment was based on the following repository.
